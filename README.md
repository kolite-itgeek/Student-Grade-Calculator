* A simple student Grade Calculator that calculate student Final score/ Grade based on student score input.
* The sum of both assignment holds 40% of the total score, while the Final Exam holds 60% of the total score.
* The Calculator takes user input of assignment 1 and assignment 2.. sum them up, then divide them by 2 to get an average score of both assignment which would be 40% of the final grade score.
  Example: (assignment 1 + assignment 2) / 2 = assignment average score.
* The calculator then again takes the average score(E.g 84) and multiply it by 0.4 to get 40% score of the final grade. Example: 84(avg scroe) * 0.4 = 33.6%(OF FINAL GRADE SCORE).
* Then multiply the Final Exam score(E.g: 75) by 0.6 to get 60%.  Example: 75(Final Exam Score) * 0.6 = 45%(OF FINAL GRADE SCORE)
* Then add the sum of both result to get the Final grade. 
  Example: Example: 33.6%(Avg %) + 45% (Final Exam score) = 78.6% (Final Grade).

* If final grade >= 70, the calculator display result as passed and indicate the pass score.
* if final grade < 70, the calculator display result as fail and indicate the failed score.
* if final grade >=70 && Final Exam score is > 90, then the calculator display and additional remark as excellent performance (This will onlt be true if both conditions are met).
