* Then the calculator takes the average score and multiply it by 0.4 to get 40% score of the final grade. Example 84 * 0.4 = 
* Then multiply the Final Exam score by 0.6 to get 60%.  Example 75 * 0.6 =
* Then add the sum of both result to get the Final grade.
  Example: (Average score x 0.4) + (Final Exam score x 0.6) = Final Grade.
